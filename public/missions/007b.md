# Mission // #007b
## Into the blinkspace breach

Through whatever means you deemed necessary, you got the blinkspace portal working again. You and Mr. Nobody's Far Field Team (he insisted) are geared up and are ready to go through and kick some of Control's ass. 

# Goals
- Party gets to set this

# Stakes
- Will the party survive whatever horrors that control has waiting for them on the other side? What about the Far Field Team? Or does Control get to finally win?

# Reserves
- None at this time.
