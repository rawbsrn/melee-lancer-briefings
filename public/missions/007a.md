# Mission // #007a
## Making friends and influencing corpros

Mr. Nobody has called in a few favors from the eggheads at the Union Science Bureau to take a look at Control's blinkspace portal. Unfortunately, without proper resources and/or more information, this portal isn't going to be sending anybody through any time soon. He suggests reaching out to your contacts at some of the big corpro states to work out a deal for their help. 

# Goals
- Get at least one of the big four to support your mission by any means neccessary (IPS-N, SSC, HORUS, HA)

# Stakes
- Will the party get the help they need to recalibrate the blinkspace portal without abusing Power at a Cost? Or are they up a Blinkspace creek without a paracasual paddle?

# Reserves
- Traitor has brought good reputation with Horus
- Example has brought good reputation with GMS
